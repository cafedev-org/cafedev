# Development requirements

CafeDev requires certain features and applications for building to be possible.

## OS and utilities

You will need to have imagemagick installed:

 * OSX: `brew install imagemagick`
 * Ubuntu: `apt-get install imagemagick`
 * Fedora/CentOS: `yum install imagemagick`

## NodeJS

NodeJS needs to be at version 6.2.2 or later. We recommend using `n` to switch versions:

```bash
sudo npm install -g n
# Mac doesn't need sudo for n to run, whereas linux does:
sudo n 6.2.2
```
