:coffee: Coders who enjoy writing. WIP.

## Setup
You'll need to satisfy the [development requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md) before using this project.

## Developing
Run `npm run watch` to watch for file changes, and `npm run server` to serve the build directory.
 
(Hint: you can just run `npm run dev` to run both commands at the same time in parallel)

A [CLI application](CLI.md) is available to assist with basic tasks.
